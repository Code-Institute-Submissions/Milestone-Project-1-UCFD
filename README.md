# FC Bayern München World

## User Centric Front End Development - Milestone Project 1

![FC Bayern München World](https://jthomp1993.github.io/Milestone-Project-1-UCFD/blob/master/assets/images/read-me-images/responsive-design.png)

FC Bayern München World, is a website that I created for FC Bayern München who are a German professional football team. 
The aim of this project was to create an intuitive website that fans of the club can visit to keep up to date with latest club news, 
results and upcoming fixtures as well as providing fans the opportunity to purchase tickets for upcoming matches, read match reports, 
buy merchandise from the shop and learn more about their favourite players. 

The main requirements for this project were to create a static front end website using all of the technologies that I have learned so far. 
To develop my website I used HTML to build the core structure and then I used CSS to style all of the elements within to make them 
appeal to the user. 

I used Bootstraps CSS library extensively throughout my project for components such as buttons, navigation bars, drop downs, carousels 
and I also made use of the handy Bootstrap grid system which enabled me to make my website responsive across all screen sizes.
