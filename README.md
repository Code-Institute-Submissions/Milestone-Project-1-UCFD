# FC Bayern München World

## User Centric Front End Development - Milestone Project 1

![FC Bayern München World](https://jthomp1993.github.io/Milestone-Project-1-UCFD/blob/master/assets/images/read-me-images/responsive-design.png)

FC Bayern München World, is a website that I created for FC Bayern München who are a German professional football team. 
The aim of this project was to create an intuitive website that fans of the club can visit to keep up to date with latest club news, 
results and upcoming fixtures as well as providing fans the opportunity to purchase tickets for upcoming matches, read match reports, 
buy merchandise from the shop and learn more about their favourite players. 

The main requirements for this project were to create a static front end website using all of the technologies that I have learned so far. 
To develop my website I used HTML to build the core structure and then I used CSS to style all of the elements within to make them 
appeal to the user. 

I used Bootstraps CSS library extensively throughout my project for components such as buttons, navigation bars, drop downs, carousels 
and I also made use of the handy Bootstrap grid system which enabled me to make my website responsive across all screen sizes. 

## User Experience 

### Main aims 

- To create a platform for fans of FC Bayern München to be able to keep up to date with the latest club news, results, upcoming fixtures 
  as well as being able to purchase tickets for upcoming matches, read match reports, buy merchandise from the shop and learn more about 
  their favourite players. 

- To use HTML and CSS to create a static front end website which is fully responsive across all screen sizes through the use of Bootstraps 
  grid system. 

- To create a website that has an intuitive navigational system through the use of, menu items, drop downs, representational icons, 
  pagination and buttons which link to different areas on the same page.

- To maintain a consistent design by using the same fonts, colours, buttons and imagery to make it more appealing to the user which will 
  make them want to continue using the website. 

## User Stories 

### Project Stakeholders 

As one of the main stakeholders in this project I am hoping to see this platform provide a useful service to the fans of the club, keeping 
them up to date with news, driving ticket sales, increasing the number of sales in the shop and also bringing new fans to the club. 

### First Time Users

I am a user who has only just discovered the team and wants to use the website to see who are the players are and learn more about them.  

My son is a fan of FC Bayern München and I’m wanting to get him tickets to a game for his birthday. We live in Dortmund so I need to find 
out when they are next playing here and buy the tickets. 

### Returning Users 

I am a user who often can’t watch the games live due to being at work, therefore I use the website after every game to see the result and 
read the match report.

I am a user who frequently uses the website to buy merchandise from the shop.

I am a user who visits the website regularly to read the club news section, this helps to ensure that I don’t miss out on any important news 
regarding the club. 

## Design Process 

### Strategy Plane 

At the beginning of my design process, I started by making a list of user stories which helped me identify who my target audience would be 
for this project. After determining my key demographic, I began researching other websites for football teams to see the pro’s and cons and 
draw some inspiration for me to implement into my own project. After carrying out research of other football teams websites it became 
apparent to me that with my current skill set and resources I would not be able to achieve the same standard as of those websites already 
out there as it would require technologies which I don’t have any knowledge of at present. However, I knew that I could use my skills in 
HTML and CSS to develop a static front end website that could provide the main aims that I want to deliver to my users.
