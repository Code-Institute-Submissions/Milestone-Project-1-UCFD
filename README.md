# FC Bayern München World

## User Centric Front End Development - Milestone Project 1

![FC Bayern München World](https://jthomp1993.github.io/Milestone-Project-1-UCFD/blob/master/assets/images/read-me-images/responsive-design.png)

FC Bayern München World, is a website that I created for FC Bayern München who are a German professional football team. 
The aim of this project was to create an intuitive website that fans of the club can visit to keep up to date with latest club news, 
results and upcoming fixtures as well as providing fans the opportunity to purchase tickets for upcoming matches, read match reports, 
buy merchandise from the shop and learn more about their favourite players. 

The main requirements for this project were to create a static front end website using all of the technologies that I have learned so far. 
To develop my website I used HTML to build the core structure and then I used CSS to style all of the elements within to make them 
appeal to the user. 

I used Bootstraps CSS library extensively throughout my project for components such as buttons, navigation bars, drop downs, carousels 
and I also made use of the handy Bootstrap grid system which enabled me to make my website responsive across all screen sizes. 

## User Experience 

### Main aims 

- To create a platform for fans of FC Bayern München to be able to keep up to date with the latest club news, results, upcoming fixtures 
  as well as being able to purchase tickets for upcoming matches, read match reports, buy merchandise from the shop and learn more about 
  their favourite players. 

- To use HTML and CSS to create a static front end website which is fully responsive across all screen sizes through the use of Bootstraps 
  grid system. 

- To create a website that has an intuitive navigational system through the use of, menu items, drop downs, representational icons, 
  pagination and buttons which link to different areas on the same page.

- To maintain a consistent design by using the same fonts, colours, buttons and imagery to make it more appealing to the user which will 
  make them want to continue using the website. 

## User Stories 

### Project Stakeholders 

As one of the main stakeholders in this project I am hoping to see this platform provide a useful service to the fans of the club, keeping 
them up to date with news, driving ticket sales, increasing the number of sales in the shop and also bringing new fans to the club. 

### First Time Users

I am a user who has only just discovered the team and wants to use the website to see who are the players are and learn more about them.  

My son is a fan of FC Bayern München and I’m wanting to get him tickets to a game for his birthday. We live in Dortmund so I need to find 
out when they are next playing here and buy the tickets. 

### Returning Users 

I am a user who often can’t watch the games live due to being at work, therefore I use the website after every game to see the result and 
read the match report.

I am a user who frequently uses the website to buy merchandise from the shop.

I am a user who visits the website regularly to read the club news section, this helps to ensure that I don’t miss out on any important news 
regarding the club. 

## Design Process 

### Strategy Plane 

At the beginning of my design process, I started by making a list of user stories which helped me identify who my target audience would be 
for this project. After determining my key demographic, I began researching other websites for football teams to see the pro’s and cons and 
draw some inspiration for me to implement into my own project. After carrying out research of other football teams websites it became 
apparent to me that with my current skill set and resources I would not be able to achieve the same standard as of those websites already 
out there as it would require technologies which I don’t have any knowledge of at present. However, I knew that I could use my skills in 
HTML and CSS to develop a static front end website that could provide the main aims that I want to deliver to my users. 

### Scope Plane 

After defining who my demographic were, I began to focus on exactly what my website was going to provide to its users. There are lots of 
features which could be added to the website of a football team so I knew it was crucial to narrow it down to a select few that would provide 
the best use to my key demographic. 

From the beginning I knew that I wanted to include a section that shows the results and upcoming fixtures as this tends to be the most common 
reason why a football fan visits their teams website. A news section that would enable users to keep up to date with what is going on with 
the club. A team section which shows the players and allows the user to learn more about them and I had thought about adding a shop section 
and a newsletter section. After much consideration I decided to just add a link to the FC Bayern München shop rather than create a whole page 
as it may have become too time consuming and also I decided that I would leave the news letter section to be added at a later date.

### Structure Plane 

After deciding what features I wanted to include and what I wanted to leave out for the time being, I began to think about how I was going 
to structure these features to create a website that is easy and intuitive to use. I decided that the pages my website would contain would be 
Home, Fixtures, Results and Team. These are the key fundamentals of what I was wanting to provide to my users and this leaves me the option 
to add a shop and club news section in a future release. However my home page is going to include links to the shop and club news section of 
the real Bayern München website so my users aren’t missing out. 

The fixtures and results section will allow users to view the results of matches and read the match reports, see what games the team having 
coming up and buy tickets. The team section allows users to see all of the players, what positions they play and learn more about each of them. 

Each page will contain a footer section which will provide links to the sponsors of the club, social media links and a button which will take 
the user back to the top of the page.
