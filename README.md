# FC Bayern München World

## User Centric Front End Development - Milestone Project 1

![FC Bayern München World](https://jthomp1993.github.io/Milestone-Project-1-UCFD/blob/master/assets/images/read-me-images/responsive-design.png)

FC Bayern München World, is a website that I created for FC Bayern München who are a German professional football team. 
The aim of this project was to create an intuitive website that fans of the club can visit to keep up to date with latest club news, 
results and upcoming fixtures as well as providing fans the opportunity to purchase tickets for upcoming matches, read match reports, 
buy merchandise from the shop and learn more about their favourite players. 

The main requirements for this project were to create a static front end website using all of the technologies that I have learned so far. 
To develop my website I used HTML to build the core structure and then I used CSS to style all of the elements within to make them 
appeal to the user. 

I used Bootstraps CSS library extensively throughout my project for components such as buttons, navigation bars, drop downs, carousels 
and I also made use of the handy Bootstrap grid system which enabled me to make my website responsive across all screen sizes. 

## User Experience 

### Main aims 

- To create a platform for fans of FC Bayern München to be able to keep up to date with the latest club news, results, upcoming fixtures 
  as well as being able to purchase tickets for upcoming matches, read match reports, buy merchandise from the shop and learn more about 
  their favourite players. 

- To use HTML and CSS to create a static front end website which is fully responsive across all screen sizes through the use of Bootstraps 
  grid system. 

- To create a website that has an intuitive navigational system through the use of, menu items, drop downs, representational icons, 
  pagination and buttons which link to different areas on the same page.

- To maintain a consistent design by using the same fonts, colours, buttons and imagery to make it more appealing to the user which will 
  make them want to continue using the website. 

## User Stories 

### Project Stakeholders 

As one of the main stakeholders in this project I am hoping to see this platform provide a useful service to the fans of the club, keeping 
them up to date with news, driving ticket sales, increasing the number of sales in the shop and also bringing new fans to the club. 

### First Time Users

I am a user who has only just discovered the team and wants to use the website to see who are the players are and learn more about them.  

My son is a fan of FC Bayern München and I’m wanting to get him tickets to a game for his birthday. We live in Dortmund so I need to find 
out when they are next playing here and buy the tickets. 

### Returning Users 

I am a user who often can’t watch the games live due to being at work, therefore I use the website after every game to see the result and 
read the match report.

I am a user who frequently uses the website to buy merchandise from the shop.

I am a user who visits the website regularly to read the club news section, this helps to ensure that I don’t miss out on any important news 
regarding the club. 

## Design Process 

### Strategy Plane 

At the beginning of my design process, I started by making a list of user stories which helped me identify who my target audience would be 
for this project. After determining my key demographic, I began researching other websites for football teams to see the pro’s and cons and 
draw some inspiration for me to implement into my own project. After carrying out research of other football teams websites it became 
apparent to me that with my current skill set and resources I would not be able to achieve the same standard as of those websites already 
out there as it would require technologies which I don’t have any knowledge of at present. However, I knew that I could use my skills in 
HTML and CSS to develop a static front end website that could provide the main aims that I want to deliver to my users. 

### Scope Plane 

After defining who my demographic were, I began to focus on exactly what my website was going to provide to its users. There are lots of 
features which could be added to the website of a football team so I knew it was crucial to narrow it down to a select few that would provide 
the best use to my key demographic. 

From the beginning I knew that I wanted to include a section that shows the results and upcoming fixtures as this tends to be the most common 
reason why a football fan visits their teams website. A news section that would enable users to keep up to date with what is going on with 
the club. A team section which shows the players and allows the user to learn more about them and I had thought about adding a shop section 
and a newsletter section. After much consideration I decided to just add a link to the FC Bayern München shop rather than create a whole page 
as it may have become too time consuming and also I decided that I would leave the news letter section to be added at a later date.

### Structure Plane 

After deciding what features I wanted to include and what I wanted to leave out for the time being, I began to think about how I was going 
to structure these features to create a website that is easy and intuitive to use. I decided that the pages my website would contain would be 
Home, Fixtures, Results and Team. These are the key fundamentals of what I was wanting to provide to my users and this leaves me the option 
to add a shop and club news section in a future release. However my home page is going to include links to the shop and club news section of 
the real Bayern München website so my users aren’t missing out. 

The fixtures and results section will allow users to view the results of matches and read the match reports, see what games the team having 
coming up and buy tickets. The team section allows users to see all of the players, what positions they play and learn more about each of them. 

Each page will contain a footer section which will provide links to the sponsors of the club, social media links and a button which will take 
the user back to the top of the page. 

### Skeleton Plane 

For me it is very important that my website is easy to navigate through to ensure a great user experience. The main navigational tool for my 
website will the be the navigation bar at the top of the page which will collapse into a dropdown menu on smaller screen sizes. As mentioned 
in the structure plane, my footer section will contain a button which will take the user back to the top of the screen to save them having 
to scroll all the way up. My fixtures and results page will feature navigational buttons that will allow them to navigate between the 
different months for ease of use. I have also consciously tried to keep the number of features on each page to a minimum to ensure each page 
is a user friendly environment. 

### Surface Plane 

After much careful consideration in thinking out my design process up until this point, it was now time for me to start sketching out my 
design in a wireframe and really start to bring my ideas to life as well as figuring out the kind of typography I am going to use, the colour 
schemes and images. 

As I began work on my wireframe in Figma, I knew that the main colours that I wanted to use throughout my website were red and white as these 
are the colours that FC Bayern München are associated with. 

I used google fonts to decide what font I wanted to use for my website and I ended up going with Exo and Sans Serif as a fall back. 
For my fonts I used a dark grey for my headings and a lighter grey for all other text which were used throughout the website to ensure 
consistency. 

I used Photoshop to create the images of the players on the Team page. I did this by getting a png image of each player from the FC Bayern 
München website and I simply added a grey background layer and then cropped the image. I added a hero image to my home and team pages as I 
believe these are always a very positive thing to be presented with first when you visit a website. 

As seen in my wireframe, I created a page which you would be taken to when you clicked on a player, containing their bio and information. 
However, after discussing my wire frame with my mentor she advised me that this may be too time consuming and isn’t necessary at this time, 
therefore I decided to leave out this feature for a future release and just link the players to the real FC Bayern München website. 

Once my wireframe was complete it was now time to start bringing it to life and I began developing it in Git Pod.

## Features 

### Features across all pages 

The navigation bar is at the top of all the pages across my website which is fully responsive across all screen sizes which I achieved using 
Bootstrap. On smaller screen sizes the navigation bar collapses into a drop down menu. I used the sticky-top Bootstrap class to make the 
navigation bar remain at the top of the screen at all times. 

The footer section is at the bottom of every page across my website. It features the logo’s of some of the sponsors of the club and link to 
their websites when clicked. Below that are links to all of the clubs social media pages. At the bottom of the footer section is a button 
which takes the user back to the top of the page to improve user experience.

### Home 

- The first thing the user will see when arriving at the home page is a carousel which features a number of images of the players.

- The next thing the user will encounter is the last result and next fixture tables which provide the location and time of the last and 
  next matches, as well as provide the user the opportunity to read the match report and buy tickets for the next game.

- The user will then move on to the club news section which consists of 6 articles which link directly to the FC Bayern München website. 
  This enables the user to keep up to date with everything happening regarding the club.

- The user will then have the opportunity to visit the FC Bayern München shop. 

- The last feature on my home page is a team section which links directly to my Team page. 

### Fixtures 

- The fixtures page consists of a table which displays the entire fixture list for 2020 across all competitions.

- The tables are divided up into months and there is a navigation bar which enables the user to easily change between the months.

- The table provides the user with the details of the locations, dates, times and competitions of each game, as well as giving the user 
  the opportunity to buy tickets for the upcoming games.

### Results 

- The results page consists of a table which displays the results of the games that have been played across all competitions in 2020.

- The same as on the fixtures page the tables are divided up into months and there is a navigation bar which enables the user to easily 
  change between the months.

- The results tables provide the user with the details of the locations, dates, times, competitions and results as well as giving the user 
  the opportunity to read the match report for each game that has been played. 

### Team 

- The first thing the the user will be presented with on the Team page is a hero image which shows the entire squad. 

- The rest of the page consists of a grid which displays all of the players divided up into the positions that they play. 
  The user can click on each players which takes them to the FC Bayern München website where they can learn more about each player. 

### Features for future releases 

- On my Home page I have included a Club News section which links to the FC Bayern München website, however in the future I would like to 
  add my own Club News page that contains all of the up to date news articles. 

- On my Home page I have a Shop section which links to the FC Bayern München website, however I would like to add my own Shop page as a 
  future release that would give users the opportunity to buy merchandise directly on my website. 

- As seen in my wireframe, I designed a page for the players that would have their bio and information but I decided to leave this out as 
  it would have taken too much time, however this is a feature I would definitely like to add in the future.

- Another feature I would like to add at a later date is a page which gives users the opportunity to sign up to a newsletter. 

## Technologies Used 

### HTML5 

This is the programming language that I used to build the main structure of my website and add all of the content. 

### CSS3

This is the programming language that I used to style the HTML5 to match my wireframe. 

### Bootstrap 

The bootstrap library was used throughout my project for various components and I used the Bootstrap grid system to make my website fully 
responsive across all screen sizes. 

### Git Hub 

I used Git hub to deploy the final version of my project to Git hub pages. 

### Version control 

Throughout the process of developing my project I used Git pods version control to make regular commits to ensure I had previous versions 
of my code stored. 

### Git Pod 

The main tool I used to build my project was Git pod’s integrated development environment. 

## Additional Tools Used 

### Figma

I used Figma to design the wireframes for my project.

### Adobe Photoshop 

I used photoshop to edit some of the images of the players for the team page in my project. 

### W3C Markup Validation Service 

When I had finished my project I ran all of my code through the W3C validator to check for errors in my HTML and CSS code. 

### Font Awesome 

I used font awesome throughout my project for representational icons and social media logo’s. 

### Google Fonts 

For my project I decided to use the font Exo which I imported from Google Fonts. 

### Free Formatter 

I used the free online formatter to format all of my HTML code to keep it tidy and improve readability. 

## Testing 

### User story tests 

### Project Stakeholder 

The creator of this project would want the platform to provide not only an inviting environment where users can easily obtain detailed 
information about the club, but also gain access to a range of services such as to buy tickets, visit the shop and bring new fans to the club. 
This was accomplished through a carefully thought out design process which the main goal was to provide an excellent standard of user experience. 

Making the website easy to navigate through was a main priority, which was achieved through a number of features such as the navigation bar, 
menu items, dropdown menu’s, pagination and buttons. The colours and typography were carefully selected to ensure the website draws in its 
users attention and makes them want to continue through the site. It was also crucial to make sure that each part of the website was not 
overcrowded which improves readability and doesn’t confuse users.
